This repo is for storing the page for visualization only, the repo for the solutions is [https://github.com/ray-pH/AOC-archive](https://github.com/ray-pH/AOC-archive).

I made a separate repo so that the [solution repo](https://github.com/ray-pH/AOC-archive) is not filled with big sized images from the visualizations. I want to keep the solution repo small in size.
